# LOL-LeagueOfLegends
Context
League of Legends is a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) where 2 teams (blue and red) face off. There are 3 lanes, a jungle, and 5 roles. The goal is to take down the enemy Nexus to win the game.

This dataset contains the first 10min. stats of approx. 10k ranked games (SOLO QUEUE) from a high ELO (DIAMOND I to MASTER). Players have roughly the same level.

Each game is unique. The gameId can help you to fetch more attributes from the Riot API.

There are 19 features per team (38 in total) collected after 10min in-game. This includes kills, deaths, gold, experience, levelâ€¦ It's up to you to do some feature engineering to get more insights.

The column blueWins is the target value (the value we are trying to predict). A value of 1 means the blue team has won. 0 otherwise.
